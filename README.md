**Description of Dataset**

**Source**
This dataset, obtained from Data.gov (United States), contains information about electric vehicles. The columns include VIN, County, City, State, Postal Code, Model Year, Make, Model, Electric Vehicle Type, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility, Electric Range, Base MSRP, Legislative District, DOL Vehicle ID, Vehicle Location, Electric Utility, and 2020 Census Tract.

**Purpose**
1. Tracking the number of electric vehicles in different counties, cities, and states over time to monitor the adoption and growth of electric transportation.
2. Analyzing the distribution of electric vehicles across legislative districts to assess the impact of policies and incentives on electric vehicle adoption.
3. Studying the electric range and other specifications of electric vehicles to assess their environmental impact and efficiency.

**Relevance**
The dataset includes information about the county, city, state, and postal code of registered electric vehicles. Analyzing this data allows us to understand the geographic distribution of electric vehicles, and identify regions with higher or lower adoption rates.
